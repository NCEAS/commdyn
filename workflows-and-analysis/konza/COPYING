Introduction
------------

The Konza Prairie LTER is dedicated to having all long-term data sets and key short-term data on-line and available to the scientific community and general public. Our goal is to have data on-line within two years of collection (as per LTER guidelines), processing and the completion of appropriate quality control procedures. We recognize that Konza LTER researchers have an obligation to make available all LTER funded data to the Konza LTER database and to publish those data in a timely fashion. We also recognized that investigators must have a reasonable opportunity for first use of data they have collected. Konza LTER data are defined and processed for online access according to the protocols outlined below.

Type I: Core, long-term data sets (with associated meta-data) that address Konza LTER objectives and hypotheses as outlined in LTER proposals I-VI and that are supported primarily by LTER funds. The goal is for data to be available on-line one year after data are generated and quality control is completed. We recognize that some data sets will take longer to get on-line than others due to the time required for adequate quality control or due to the demand for certain data by others.

Type II: Short-term data sets supported primarily by LTER funds, key short- or long-term data sets supported by other funding, graduate student data sets, discontinued long-term data sets, one-time surveys, etc. Data sets in the above categories that are supported primarily by LTER funds must be made available to the data manager/PI’s and may be placed on line within 2 years of completing quality control -- but only at the discretion of the data manager/PIs. Data not supported by LTER funds will be placed on line only if mutually agreed upon by the investigator(s) and the data manager/PIs.
