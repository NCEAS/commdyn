##Introduction
As long-term datasets increase in scope and length, new analytical tools are being developed to capture patterns of species interactions over time. This has the potential to vastly expand our understanding of ecology. For example, many traditional measurements of community structure, such as diversity indices and rank-abundance curves, represent 'snapshots in time' that poorly capture community dynamics. In contrast, the development of related but temporal metrics, such as species turnover and rank shifts, has highlighted how much communities can vary over time. Similarly, species dynamics can affect the stability of community properties. A growing number of synthesis studies have applied new metrics to long-term datasets to test what factors influence the stability of ecosystems. As ecological records continue to grow and data storage and sharing barriers diminish, it is likely that these types of long-term studies will underpin many new advances in ecology.

However, there are several impediments to the broad adoption of temporal analyses by the ecological community. First, many metrics of community dynamics have not yet been published as functions in R. Although R is becoming the programming language of choice for most ecologists, the majority of ecologists rely on published instead of self-written functions. The primary R package for vegetation analyses, vegan, includes many diversity indices and ordination techniques but does not include temporal metrics of community patterns. Second, most temporal metrics are applied to datasets that include spatial as well as temporal replication. This adds an additional layer of complexity that may stall their general use and application. Third, many metrics of temporal dynamics are actively being developed, and so ecologists may be unfamiliar with the metrics available and their pros and cons.

Here we present a new R package, `codyn`, that fills this niche for published functions that characterize communities over time. Short for “community dynamics,” `codyn` functions are explicitly temporal and can be easily implemented over multiple spatial replicates. Functions in `codyn` fall into two categories: temporal diversity indices and community stability metrics. Below we describe the metrics by category and demonstrate their application with an example for the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research Site, Manhattan KS.

##Temporal Diversity Indices
The diversity indices in `codyn` are temporal analogs to traditional diversity indices such as richness and rank-abundance curves.
